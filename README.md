# spring-boot-oauth2
**Trial Task**

Create an auth microservice, which stores user details in memory and provides both authorization and authentication through social media like google and facebook. There should be sign in/sign up processes and I want to see user data in afterwards via REST endpoints.

Requirements:
* Spring Framework
* Testable microservice
* DB either postgres or H2
* Unit and integration tests
* Postman collection of REST calls.
